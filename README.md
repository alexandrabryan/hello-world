# hello-world
A repository to store my resources as I learn to code

New to development, and just practicing my first GitHub  project.

Have experience in HTML and CSS from a past life as an email marketing manager, but beyond that I'm straight Jon Snow here. 
Currently working through Progate lessons to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
